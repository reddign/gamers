Functionality:

    create.php:
        Writes new scores to the highscores table in the triviagames database.

    read.php:
        Retrieves scores from the highscores table in the triviagames database.
        Shows the table for the top 10 scores.

    unittest.php:
        A simple page for testing that emulates the login and game completion process
        to manually enter data into the highscores table.
        Can submit directly via create.php or via scoreSend.js

    scoreSend.js
        Writes new scores to the highscores table in the triviagames database.
        (Helpful because uses JS function)

    high_scores.SQL
        Creates high scores table within triviagames database.
        Also has examples of dummy players and scores for testing purposes


Local deployment:
    1) Run SQL statements to create table
    2) Go on website to see the UI/functionality of read.php 
    3) Use unittest.php to test create.php or scoreSend.js


User interface:

    Users can view the highscores at http://localhost/gamers/web_src/games/menu.php
using the "View Highscores" button. This can be accessed from the games page or after
completing the trivia game. This calls read.php which is located in this folder.

Future goals:
    1) Have a high score table show up after a game is finished.
    2) More filtering and accessibility of data. Be able to query/change what the table shows
